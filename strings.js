//strings are words that you can recall like a variable
var thingsThatILike=("Dogs, and golf, and not Joey")
console.log(thingsThatILike)

//You can combine integers and Strings

console.log("There are " + 3 + " things that I like and they are " + thingsThatILike)

//There are some functions that you can do with strings. Here are some examples:

var bestCollegeMascots=("Butler Blue III");

console.log(bestCollegeMascots.length);
console.log(bestCollegeMascots.toUpperCase());
console.log(bestCollegeMascots.toLowerCase());
console.log(bestCollegeMascots.split(" "));
console.log(bestCollegeMascots.slice(6));

//these are called js integer methods
