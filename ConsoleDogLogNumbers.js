//JavaScript sees all numbers as integers (don't ask me my math mind doesn't like it either)!

console.log(1);
console.log(1.1);

//You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulate

console.log(1+1);
console.log(1.1+1);
console.log(3-1);
console.log(3*3);
console.log(14%3);

//You can also check for numbers with JavaScript

console.log(isNaN("dogs"));
console.log(isNaN(45));
